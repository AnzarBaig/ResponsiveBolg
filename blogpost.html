        <p class="font1">Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",
            which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and
            code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

            A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of
            itself (objects have a notion of this or self). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of
            objects that interact with one another.[1][2] OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are
            class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.

            Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and
            they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with
            imperative, procedural programming. Significant object-oriented languages include: Java, C++, C#, Python.
            Object-oriented programming uses objects, but not all of the associated techniques and structures are
            supported directly in languages that claim to support OOP. The features listed below are common among
            languages considered to be strongly class- and object-oriented
